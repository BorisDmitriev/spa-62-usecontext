# SPA-useContext-To-Do-App

Create a React application that simulates a todo list. The application should have the following features:

-   An input field where the user can add a new task.
-   A list of tasks that the user can add to it
-   The ability to remove tasks from the list

The application should use a state container to manage the state of the todo list. The state container should provide the following methods:

-   `addTask(task)`: Adds the specified task to the todo list.
-   `removeTask(task)`: removes the specified task from the todo list
-   `getTaskCount()`: Returns the number of tasks in the todo list

Use components to split the application into smaller, reusable parts. Make sure your components access the state container via props to update the state of the todo list.

Bonus points if you style the application with CSS and create a user-friendly interface.
